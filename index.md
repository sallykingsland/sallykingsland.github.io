## Finding the help you need
<p>
</p>  
Are you questioning where you are in life? Or perhaps feeling stuck? Or just pretty miserable? Whether you are actively seeking to understand yourself or wanting help to deal with life's challenges, I welcome you. 

I firmly believe that we all possess the inner wisdom necessary for healing and personal growth. As a trained therapist, I am here to work with your unique needs and support and facilitate a process to help you.

I work with adults and older teens who may be grappling with anxiety and/or depression, a general sense of unease, or various other psychological and relational challenges. Within the safety of our therapeutic space, you will have the freedom to explore what is going on for you.

## Jungian Psychotherapy

<p>
</p>  

Psychodynamic psychotherapy, including Jungian psychotherapy, is an effective way to address a wide range of psychological problems and challenges. Jonathan Shedler is one author you may find helpful to look up to find out more.

I seek to support you in figuring out what is going on for you in a non-pathologising way. While anxiety and depression are the common results of psychological distress, the causes are varied and require careful exploration with each individual. Jungian psychotherapy can lead to increased understanding of yourself and improved relationships.

## Sandplay Therapy

I also offer sandplay with a full set up of wet and dry sand trays (photos below). Sandplay is a profoundly powerful modality that allows for expression without words.
