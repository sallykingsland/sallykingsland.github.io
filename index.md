## Embark on a Journey of Self-Discovery and Transformation
<p>
</p>  
Are you awakening to the depths of your inner life? Feeling frustrated or just plain miserable? Whether you are actively seeking a connection with your inner world or simply find yourself thrust into it by life's disruptions, I welcome you. Together, we can navigate the path towards growth and transformation, guided by the wisdom that resides within each of us.

In my practice, I firmly believe that we all possess the inner wisdom necessary for healing and personal growth. As a trained therapist, I am here to support and facilitate your unique process.

I understand that seeking therapy can be both difficult and courageous. I work with adults and older teens who may be grappling with anxiety, depression, a general sense of unease, or various other challenges, despite often appearing fine or successful on the surface. Within the safety of our therapeutic space, you will have the freedom to explore what is going on for you.

## Jungian Psychotherapy

<p>
</p>  

Utilising the principles of Jungian psychodynamic psychotherapy, I adopt a non-pathologising approach to support the untangling of unconscious patterns. . My holistic perspective and symbolic stance honours the meaningful nature of your experiences, pointing the way towards healing.

While therapy is not always easy, it stands as one of the most important investments you can make in your life. Through our work together, you can experience improved relationships, self-acceptance, and a deeper sense of self.
