				<hr>
				<p>
					My name is Sally Kingsland and I am honoured to accompany people, as a spiritual companion, on their journey through life.
				</p>
				<p>
					These days I work primarily as a Jungian psychotherapist. I have undertaken training with the
					<a href="http://www.anzap.com.au/">Australian & NZ Association of Psychotherapists</a>.
					Therapy tends to involve more regular sessions than spiritual direction which typically occurs about once a month.  I do not undertake psychotherapy while serving as a spiritual companion and do not bring spiritual matters into my psychotherapy practice unless specifically requested.
