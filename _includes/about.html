				<hr>
				<p>
					My name is Sally Kingsland, a Jungian psychotherapist. I have also undertaken training with the
					<a href="http://www.anzap.com.au/">Australian & NZ Association of Psychotherapists</a>. 
				</p>    
				<p>	Having served as a Spiritual Director/Companion (from a Quaker orientation) for many years I am comfortable working with spiritual and religious questions and concerns. I work with pepole of any faith background including those with no religious beliefs or interest.  
				</p>    
				<p>	I am available to see people in person in inner North Canberra, Australia, or via online video-conferencing. I offer online sessions via Coviu, a secure platform that does not require you to download any software.</p>
        		        <p>	I work across multiple time zones, including the USA where I lived for five years.
